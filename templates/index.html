            <h3>Broken Access Control (A01:2021)</h3>
            <p><b>Example: </b>
                <a href="/admin">Broken Access Control</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Problem: </b>
                The web app grants access to an admin login (eg. phpMyAdmin) based on a cookie value
                (<i>admin=True</i>).
                The problem here is that this value can be set by an attacker himself (e.g. using a browser extension or
                a proxy like Burp Suite).
                The insufficient access control gives unauthorized people access to the admin interface.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Mitigation: </b>
                One possible solution would be server-side verification.
                In this case, the web app would look up a database and verify that the current user trying to access the
                admin interface actually has the permission to do so (eg. admin property set).

            <h3>Server-Side Request Forgery (A10:2021)</h3>
            <p><b>Example: </b>
                <a href="/analyzer">SSRF</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Problem: </b>
                The web application processes the URL submitted through the user without validating its domain.
                The problem that results through this is that a user might submit an internal address (from the local
                network).
                This allows an attacker eg. to map the internal network (reconnaissance, port scanning).
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Mitigation: </b>
                In order to defend against this type of vulnerability, user supplied input should be sanitized and
                validated.
                All private (internal) ip addresses and hostnames (eg. "localhost") should be filtered.
            </p>
